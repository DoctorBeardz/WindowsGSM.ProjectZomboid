## Features

What it will do:

- Create a "Zomboid" folder in the main server file folder for centralized saves and configs, no longer using the default Zomboid folder in %User%
- Use the WindowsGSM port for the server

What it will NOT do:

- Set the public server name
- Set the max player number
- Set any maps, mods or any other settings

All of that needs to be done by editing the servertest.ini files in the "serverfiles\Zomboid\Server" folder
