# WindowsGSM.ProjectZomboid
ðŸ§© WindowsGSM plugin for supporting Project Zomboid Dedicated Server 

## Requirements
[WindowsGSM](https://github.com/WindowsGSM/WindowsGSM) >= 1.21.0

## Installation
1. Download the [latest](https://github.com/DoctorBeardz/WindowsGSM.ProjectZomboid/releases/latest) release
1. Move **ProjectZomboid.cs** folder to **plugins** folder
1. Click **[RELOAD PLUGINS]** button or restart WindowsGSM

## Info
It will be necessary to edit the proper servertest.ini files for all the sandbox and server settings to be used properly.

After launching the server, make sure to Toggle open the server console and write your custom "admin" account password to the console. You only need to do this once when the server is launched for the first time.

Most code and inspiration taken from:

[BattlefieldDuck](https://github.com/BattlefieldDuck/WindowsGSM.ARMA3)

## Features

What it will do:

- Create a "Zomboid" folder in the main server file folder for centralized saves and configs, no longer using the default Zomboid folder in %User%
- Use the WindowsGSM port for the server

What it will NOT do:

- Set the public server name
- Set the max player number
- Set any maps, mods or any other settings

All of that needs to be done by editing the servertest.ini files in the "WindowsGSM\servers\\<server id\>\Zomboid\Server" folder
